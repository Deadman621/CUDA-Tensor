# Tensor

This project implements tensors and their related operations from scratch using CUDA. The goal of this project is to leverage neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process; however, this remains incomplete.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PINN
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have CMake and a CUDA-capable compiler installed on your system.

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the PINN implementation using the following command:

```bash
./pinn_executable
```

Replace `pinn_executable` with the actual name of the compiled binary.

## Overview

The PINN framework consists of several components:

- **Neural Network Architecture:** Defined in `network.cu` and `network.h`, this includes layers, forward and backward passes, and loss calculations.
- **Utility Functions:** Implemented in `utils.cu` and declared in `utils.h`, these functions assist with data handling and normalization.
- **Main Execution:** The `main.cu` file initializes the network, sets up the training process, and manages CUDA kernel execution.
